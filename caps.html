        <h1> Welcome to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</h1>
        <p1>We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual services. CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health.</p1>

        <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>
        <p2>Individual peer counseling is a service provided by CAPS that allows students to talk to other students who are trained to provide support. This service is free and confidential.</p2>

       <p>Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.</p>

       <p>Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our annual reports.</p>
